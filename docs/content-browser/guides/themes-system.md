## Theme Selection Guidelines

1. **Main Focus**: What is the primary subject?
2. **Content Type**: What type of content is it?
3. **Use Case**: How will this content be used?

**Example:** An article about "Wayne Gretzky's Business Ventures"
- Could be: Players OR Business & Finance
- Primary: **Business & Finance** (main focus is business, player is context)
- Secondary consideration: Could tag with "Wayne Gretzky" for player connection

### Theme vs Category vs Tag

- **Theme**: High-level categorization (13 options)
- **Category**: Sub-categorization within theme (varies by theme)
- **Tag**: Specific keywords for searchability (unlimited)

**Example:**
- Theme: **Players**
- Category: **Player Spotlight**
- Tags: `["Wayne Gretzky", "NHL", "Records", "Goals"]`
