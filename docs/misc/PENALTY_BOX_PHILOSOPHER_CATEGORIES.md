## Implementation Notes

- These themes are displayed in the theme cloud on the Rink Philosopher page
- Clicking a theme filters items from `collection_hockey_culture` where:
  - `attribution = "Rink Philosopher"`
  - `theme = [selected theme]`
- Daily Selection comes from `collection_hockey_culture` filtered by `attribution = "Rink Philosopher"`
- Each theme displays first 12 items in a 3×4 grid

## Note: Facts Are Separate

Facts (Rules and penalties, History, Records and stats, NHL vs. youth vs. college, Goalie facts, Equipment, Tech, Fun trivia) are a separate category and should NOT be combined with Penalty Box Philosopher content.
