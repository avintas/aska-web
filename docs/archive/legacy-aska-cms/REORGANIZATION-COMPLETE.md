## 📊 Results

### Before
- 107 documents in flat structure
- Hard to find specific documents
- Mix of current and historical docs
- No clear organization

### After
- ~84 active documents organized by domain
- ~23 archived documents preserved
- Easy navigation by functional area
- Complete context in each domain folder
- Clear separation of current vs. historical

---

## 🎯 Benefits

### For AI-Assisted Development
- **Complete Context**: Point to a domain folder for all related documentation
- **No Hunting**: All related docs grouped together
- **Historical Context**: History included in domain folders
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each domain is self-contained

### For Human Developers
- **Logical Organization**: Find docs by what you're working on
- **Complete Picture**: See all aspects of a feature together
- **Easy Onboarding**: New developers can explore by domain
- **Clear Structure**: Consistent organization across domains

---

## 📝 Key Files Updated

- `docs/README.md` - Updated with domain overview
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md` - Complete rewrite with domain-based structure
- Domain README files created for each domain folder
- Archive README created

## 🚀 How to Use

### For AI-Assisted Development

**Example:** "Work on trivia sets"
→ Point to `docs/trivia/`
→ I read all files in that folder for complete context

### For Human Developers

1. Navigate to the domain folder for your feature
2. Read the domain README.md for overview
3. Explore subfolders (api/, implementation/, guides/) as needed
4. Check history/ for context

---

## 📚 Next Steps

1. **Test Navigation**: Verify documents are easy to find
2. **Update Cross-References**: Update any internal document links if needed
3. **Maintain Structure**: Add new documents to appropriate domain folders
4. **Regular Reviews**: Review archive quarterly for cleanup

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with Domain README**: Each domain has a README.md with overview
- **Use Domain Folders**: Point to domain folder for complete context
- **Check Archive**: Historical docs preserved in archive/
- **Follow Structure**: Add new docs to appropriate domain folders

---

**Status:** Reorganization complete! Documents are now organized by functional domain for easy context gathering. 🎉
